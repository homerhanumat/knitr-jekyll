I am a mathematics professor at [Georgetown College](http://www.georgetowncollege.edu/mpc/).  I'm interested in statistics and the teaching of it, especially with R.  You can get some sense of how I go about this by visiting the web page for our [elementary course](http://statistics.georgetowncollege.edu).
